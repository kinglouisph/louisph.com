		<h3>Project 1</h3>
		<p>
			The goal of this project is to find what places in the country have the best and worst weather. It uses a database of 8.6 million weather events recorded nationwide across seven years. The importance of this data is primarily to real estate: housing in areas with better weather should become more desirable.

		<h4>Methodology</h4>
		<p>
		The data I used for this project is a large database of nationwide weather events from a period of seven years. The uncompressed file size is very big, making processing the data very slow. This was not at all helped by the fact that I was using python. </p><p>
			The first thing I did was create a new table with the sums of results of previous tables. The new table contained total amounts of rainfall, snowfall, etc, and the lengths of time (in seconds) affected by rain, snow, etc. </p><p>
			This list lists the data points by airport. Airports are used because city and zip code contain many nulls, and Airports were the smallest "unit". averaging scores by county was another option but that felt like blurring the data for no reason, since counties could just be pulled from the airports.</p><p>
			The next thing I did was use this list to find the maxima and minima in each catigory. This was very straightforward with the new list. Note that the below values are per year (tolals / 7), and the days of precipitation represent contiguous days of weather, not the number of days that the weather occurred. That number is likely double or triple the amount shown.
		</p>
		<h4>Maxima</h4>
		<table>
			<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Airport</th><th>Value</th></tr>
	
<tr><td>daysCold</td><td>KAWN</td><td>173.4</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysFog</td><td>KMWN</td><td>68.98</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysHail</td><td>KGOV</td><td>0.97</td></tr>
<tr><td>inRain</td><td>KUIL</td><td>206.74</td></tr>

<tr><td>inPrecipitation</td><td>KJRB</td><td>7232.15</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysPrecipitation</td><td>K5H4</td><td>34.87</td></tr>	

		</table>
		<p>
			KJRB (Washington state) apparently got <b>~0.8 miles</b> of misc. precipitation over a 7 year period. KUIL (also Washington State) also got 200in of rain per year, despite Washington state averaging ~35in or rain per year (google). KMWN (Mount Washington, NH) apparently is suffering from a storm ~46% of the time.

		<h4>Minima</h4>
		<table>
			<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Airport</th><th>Value</th></tr>

<tr><td>daysCold</td><td>KLAS</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysFog</td><td>KJGG</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysHail</td><td>K04V</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>inRain</td><td>KJGG</td><td>0.0</td></tr>

<tr><td>daysStorm</td><td>KSPA</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>inPrecipitation</td><td>KEMM</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysPrecipitation</td><td>KEMM</td><td>0.0</td></tr>

		</table>
		<p>
			Note that KJGG (Coastal Virginia) apparently had no rain for seven years. It seems to only have recorded some severe cold, less than an hour of storm, and 200in of miscellaneous precipitation.	
		</p>

		<p>
			Clearly these results are not trustworthy. The next thing I did was try to take the results at percentiles, in the hope that they would have less junk data. The results for days of precipitation, however, are much more reasonable, and much more likely to be correct.
		</p>
		<h4>Medians</h4>
		<table>
	
<tr><td>daysCold</td><td>KCRX</td><td>1.57</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysFog</td><td>KISO</td><td>6.369</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysHail</td><td>KDCY</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>inRain</td><td>KCQT</td><td>31.735</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysRain</td><td>KPTN</td><td>16.338</td></tr>
<tr><td>inSnow</td><td>KLFI</td><td>0.721</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysSnow</td><td>KMTN</td><td>2.398</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysStorm</td><td>KMEZ</td><td>0.019</td></tr>
<tr><td>inPrecipitation</td><td>KMSS</td><td>5.717</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysPrecipitation</td><td>KOKV</td><td>0.186</td></tr>	
		</table>
		<p>
			These results seem reasonable! The median yearly inches of rainfall aligns with the 

		<h4>25th Percentiles</h4>
		<table>
			<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Airport</th><th>Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>daysCold</td><td>KTPA</td><td>0.53</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysFog</td><td>KEHR</td><td>4.124</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysHail</td><td>KDCY</td><td>0.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>inRain</td><td>KSHL</td><td>10.112</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysRain</td><td>KMWN</td><td>9.655</td></tr>
<tr><td>inSnow</td><td>KEDW</td><td>0.044</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysSnow</td><td>KBRO</td><td>0.188</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysStorm</td><td>KFKN</td><td>0.001</td></tr>
<tr><td>inPrecipitation</td><td>KBLU</td><td>1.088</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysPrecipitation</td><td>KOQN</td><td>0.047</td></tr>
		</table>

		<p>
			These results still seem like junk, but much less so than the minima. The data on snow is believable, but I still find the annual rainfall number suspicious.
		</p>
		<h4>90th Percentiles</h4>
		<table>
		
<tr><td>daysCold</td><td>KFSW</td><td>10.505</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysFog</td><td>KMQS</td><td>13.187</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysHail</td><td>KHQZ</td><td>0.006</td></tr>
<tr><td>inRain</td><td>KJAX</td><td>83.797</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysRain</td><td>KSGH</td><td>26.877</td></tr>
<tr><td>inSnow</td><td>KHDN</td><td>5.438</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysSnow</td><td>KBHK</td><td>15.307</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysStorm</td><td>K8D3</td><td>0.432</td></tr>
<tr><td>inPrecipitation</td><td>KCTZ</td><td>25.665</td></tr>
<tr><td>daysPrecipitation</td><td>KMCN</td><td>0.611</td></tr>	

		</table>

		<p>
			These results look reasonable. The KJAX rainfall numbers may look high but it's in florida, so that's to be expected. The reason I hypothesize this is more accurate than the 25 percentile results is that it seems much easier to underestimate weather events by simply not recording them than it is to overestimate. The errors used to overestivate (misreading measurements, faulty equipment, etc) also are more likely to work both ways. Still, the 95 percentile data looked suspicious so I used 90 percintile instead.
